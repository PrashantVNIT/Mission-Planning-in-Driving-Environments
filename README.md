# Mission-Planning-in-Driving-Environments
**Idea of this project is to:**
* Implement Dijkstra's search algorithm on a road network graph.
* Implement the A* search algorithm using a Euclidean heuristic on a road network graph. 

In this we are implementing Dijkstra's search algorithm on a road network in Berkeley, California and then modifying this algorithm using a distance heuristic to perform A* search.

In this project, we will be relying on the [OSMNX library](https://osmnx.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to generate Python graphs from Open Street Map (OSM) data. These graphs will be represented using the [NetworkX library](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/). Both of these links are to the documentation, which you will find useful in this project.
